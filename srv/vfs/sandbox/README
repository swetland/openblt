This is a test harness for developing filesystem drivers under UNIX to
be used on OpenBLT.  Its design was inspired by a similar system written
by Dominic Giampaolo for designing BFS as described in *Practical
Filesystem Design with the Be File System*.

This code is guaranteed to build on OpenBSD/sparc, but should build on
other UNIX systems.  It will probably also build on UNIX-like systems
such as Linux.  I will eventually make it work on BeOS.  To build, type
`make' as this is not built during a normal build.


Some caveats:

    - add -DVFS_SANDBOX to $(CF) in make.conf
    - if you're using this on an architecture other than Intel, remember
      to rebuild the driver you're testing, fs.o, super.o, and hash.o
